My name is Christopher Tolbert, a data scientist. I have the following qualities:

- Mathematics and economics undergrad
- MBA, specializing in Operations
- Limited professional DS experience, but continuing to build cool projects
- Sports, music, finance = "What piques my interest?"

### Who I am
My curiosity with numbers started early in life. Second grade. Mr. Jackson's class. The big jar of jellybeans that I wanted to win so bad, as long as I guessed the number. I tried to figure out how many rows of jellybeans and how many per row. I didn't win, but I wanted to quantify and enumerate everything around me. I was also the kid that spent more time making excel charts for my Madden Football team than playing the game. I always thought that if I constructed the right combination of "numbers" I could beat any team.
